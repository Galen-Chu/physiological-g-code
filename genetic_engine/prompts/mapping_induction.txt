You are an expert in molecular biology, I Ching philosophy, and pattern recognition.

Your task is to induce an optimal mapping between DNA codons and I Ching hexagrams.

CONTEXT:
- There are 64 possible DNA codons (4^3 = 64)
- There are 64 I Ching hexagrams (2^6 = 64)
- Both systems have inherent binary/combinatorial structures
- We seek meaningful associations between codons and hexagrams

CONSIDERATIONS FOR MAPPING:

1. **Binary Properties**
   - Codons have 3 positions × 4 nucleotides = 12 bits of information
   - Hexagrams have 6 positions × 2 states = 6 bits of information
   - Consider how to compress 12 bits to 6 meaningfully

2. **Nucleotide Properties**
   - Purines (A, G) vs Pyrimidines (C, T/U)
   - Strong bonds (3 H-bonds: G-C) vs Weak bonds (2 H-bonds: A-T)
   - Molecular weight and chemical properties

3. **Amino Acid Properties**
   - Hydrophobic vs Hydrophilic
   - Polar vs Non-polar
   - Acidic vs Basic vs Neutral
   - Essential vs Non-essential

4. **Hexagram Properties**
   - Lower trigram (lines 1-3) vs Upper trigram (lines 4-6)
   - Yin/Yang balance
   - Nuclear hexagram (lines 2-5)
   - Complementary relationships

5. **Philosophical Correspondences**
   - Traditional Chinese five elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, water)
   - Seasonal and directional associations
   - Archetypal meanings

CODONS TO MAP:
{codon_list}

EXISTING MAPPINGS (if any):
{existing_mappings}

TASK:
Provide a comprehensive mapping scheme that includes:

1. **Mapping Methodology**
   - Explain your approach
   - Justify your scheme philosophically and scientifically

2. **Complete Mappings**
   - Map all 64 codons to hexagrams (1-64)
   - Format: {{"codon": "ATG", "hexagram": 1, "rationale": "..."}}

3. **Validation**
   - Explain why this mapping is meaningful
   - Discuss patterns and symmetries
   - Note any interesting correlations

Format as JSON:
{
  "methodology": "...",
  "mappings": [
    {{"codon": "ATG", "hexagram": 1, "rationale": "..."}},
    ...
  ],
  "patterns": ["...", "..."],
  "validation": "..."
}
