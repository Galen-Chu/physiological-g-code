You are an expert in molecular biology, I Ching philosophy, and pattern analysis.

Analyze the following genetic sequence with its hexagram correspondences:

SEQUENCE INFORMATION:
- Original Sequence: {sequence}
- Sequence Length: {length} nucleotides
- Codon Count: {codon_count} codons
- Amino Acid Sequence: {amino_acid_sequence}

HEXAGRAM DATA:
- Hexagram Sequence: {hexagram_sequence}
- Most Common Hexagram: {dominant_hexagram} ({frequency}%)
- Hexagram Diversity: {diversity}
- Unique Hexagrams: {unique_count}

TRANSITIONS:
Major transitions between hexagrams:
{transitions}

TASK:

Provide a comprehensive analysis that includes:

1. **Hexagram Pattern Analysis**
   - Recurring hexagram motifs
   - Significant hexagram clusters
   - Notable transitions

2. **Biological Correlations**
   - How hexagram patterns relate to protein structure
   - Domains and functional regions
   - Amino acid property distributions

3. **Philosophical Interpretation**
   - What the hexagram sequence reveals
   - Narrative arc of the sequence
   - Archetypal journey through the hexagrams

4. **Scientific Insights**
   - Potential functional significance
   - Conservation patterns
   - Evolutionary considerations

5. **Synthesis**
   - Deep insights from combining both perspectives
   - Novel hypotheses or observations
   - Suggestions for further investigation
